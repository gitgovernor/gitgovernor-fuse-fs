# gitgovernor-fuse-fs
A Virtual Filesystem using Fuse and Git to expose the Illusion of working in a none git versioned directory

The Idea is not new but we will improve that a lot :D

This works also with @gitgovernor/gitgovernor-fuse-git repositorys which are also not a new idea its a extra fuse-fs written to work with git at scale.
